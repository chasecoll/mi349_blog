        Hello, my name is Chase and I'm a student at MSU studying media and information. I've always enjoyed media, be it through tv shows,
        video games, or even music. Media has a way of captivating an audience in an instant which I find fascinating. With such a wide variety 
        of media for consumption the industry never gets old. There is always new media, new platforms, and new trends, it's an industry that's always
        changing. This is part of the reason why I find it so interesting. Getting to work with several different platforms, doing multiple activities,
        ranging from user design to research. The fact that everyday in media is new is likely the largest reason why I entered this field.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the future I hope to dive deeper into user design and research as well as advertising. Marketing is very interesting to me, especially
        the connection with Psychology. I love that a designer can place him/herself in the shoes of their target audience and think the way that they
        do. Using that knowledge of Psychology to benefit the design of the website is very smart and extremely interesting. I understand that 
        it is a very competitive field, but I am very motivated. I just need to keep working and learn as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
        So far I can use a decent amount of software, but I need to continue learning. As of now I know and can use,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Final Cut Pro</li>
            <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
            <li>Adobe Premiere Pro</li>
            <li>Adobe Audition</li>
            <li>C++, Python, and HTML</li>
            <li>Microsoft Office</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With all of these platforms at my disposal the level of media I can create is drastically increasing. As of now I will be doing my 
            best to fine tune my knowledge of these platforms. Afterwards I'll keep working on my portfolio. All the extra time I have due to 
            Covid-19 will help me boost my portfolio and hopefully learn some new tricks about the software I own. I hope you're enjoying
            the blog, feel free to keep reading more of my posts! </p>
